# dragonfight
A command line text program in the vein of a choose your own adventure story. The goal was to create a program that asks the user to choose a character based on the basic dungeons and dragons classes. Fighter, mage, or thief. Each character would have different moves, and they would be fighting a dragon that would have its own moves. 
It would be turn based, and I based the gameplay on a Pokemon battle. There would be health for the player and the dragon. When one reaches below 0, the game ends and the winner is declared.
The learning goal for this program was to learn how to deal with player input with multiple options. The player can choose to be 1 of 3 characters, and all the characters have different moves. The difference between the moves is admittedly name differences, but I wanted to learn how to effectively deal with creating a program that can have many branching options.
